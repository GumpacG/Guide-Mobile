    "The Grand Wall":
      "The boulders in the lush, Grand Wall forest are the most important in this book." +
      "This region is where the first, real squamish boulder problems were developed and " +
      "the area remains immensely popular to this day. For some, the forest is almosr a spiritual " +
      "place - giant cedars swat in the afternoon breeze, soft moss cushions the feet and if you get " +
      "up early enough, the yipping of coyotes may be heard as trains rumble by the distance. This " +
      "area has been intriguing climbers since the early 1960s when the first squamish wall rats used" +
      " boulders such as Eleven-bolt Rock to practice their skills, but it wasn't until the mid-1990s " +
      "that systemic bouldering exploration took place. Todaym despite increasing development in many " +
      "other, high quality zones, this forest continues to be the epicenter of Squamish bouldering",
